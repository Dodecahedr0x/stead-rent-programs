# Stead Rent Programs

This repository contains the program to turn an NFT into an rentable art gallery. It can be applied used for any NFT but is thought for real estate projects such as Solstead

Owners of a stead can create an exhibition for their token. The artist that will be able to exhibit pieces must be known when creating the exhibition.
Once the exhibition created, the artist can deposit any number of NFT in the exhibition and define a price for each of them.
A buyer can then buy each exposed pieces at the defined price.

All tokens are stored in an escrow account. This allows easily finding all the NFT stored in the gallery.
The programs protects both the stead owner and the artist with the following principles:

- A stead owner can cancel the exhibition anytime and immediatly get back his stead. However, a new exhibition cannot be started until the current one is closed, which requires the artist to withdraw all the pieces in the exhibition.
- An artist can withdraw any pieces at anytime, except the stead.
